# flutter_base_counter

This is the base project to use during BLoC Pattern exercises 

## Getting Started

1. Remember we need the BLoC Dependencies added to the base project
2. Removed all the unecessary boiler plate comments, and counter stuff out of the flutter_base project that we won't use


Exercise #1


1. Add a counter_cubit (leverage the vs code plugin)
a. Remove the unnecessary stuff created by default when creating counter_state
b. Add the  counterValue state we care about to CounterState
c. Add CounterState constructor  and make counterValue required property
d. Modify counter_cubit constructor to initialize it's state
e. Add two methods increment decrement to do something with the cubit state
